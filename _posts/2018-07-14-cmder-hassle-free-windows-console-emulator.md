### Overview

I spent most of my coding career using Windows but last 2016, I needed to start using [Mac OS X][osx] full-time. The transition is quite smooth but one should get use to pressing the Command Key (`âŒ˜`) instead of Control (`Ctrl`). After I got used to it, the ergonomic experience felt more natural as less hand re-positioning is needed.

Aside from typing experience, one major thing I like with OS X is the Unix command line. The commands are quite powerful and detailed. Also, if the user has experience with Linux, he/she would not have any problem in using the command-line of OS X.

Due to some circumstance, I needed to use Windows again as my development environment. How will I transition back to Windows? Am I doomed? *\*sobs\**

### Questions

1. Should I just use the Windows Command Prompt? *Definitely \*pause\* not.*

2. How can I have access to Unix commands in Windows?

3. Should I just follow my old setup of ConEmu + Git Bash?

4. Is there a more convenient tool or setup especially for software developers using Windows?

5. How about the pleasing user interface from OS X?

### Discovery

Upon setting up my development environment for Windows, luckily, I found the [Cmder][cmder] tool!

The tool answered all the concerns I mentioned on the previous section. Below are some of its features that I super duper love.

1. Built on top [ConEmu][conemu]

    * Accessible ConEmu goodies i.e. tabs, tabs, tabs, and more tabs.
    * Layout and interface are still the same.

2. Unix and Git commands served hot

    * Commands are automatically injected to the `PATH` environment variable.

3. Look and feel

    * The Monokai color scheme is very appealing especially the grayish background.

**Note:** [Git for Windows][gitforwindows] is only available for the full version of the installer.

**Pro Tip:** Just get the full version. It is really that convenient.

### Conclusion

I have been using Cmder for quite some time now. In my opinion, the convenience and features that Cmder brings, makes it the best free console emulator for Windows.

Cheers!
