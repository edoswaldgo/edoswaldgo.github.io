### Overview
Using a [VCS (Version Control System)][vcs] is a common tool for source code management. It is very helpful not only for projects involving multiple team members but also for solo projects. Given that many members are involved, it is inevitable to encounter source conflicts or differences upon submitting changes to the repository.

[Diff][diff] tools are available in order to help people view the source differences. It can show which files/lines of the source code are added, modified, and/or deleted. The output format of diff tools may vary but still, they address the issue on displaying source differences.

One example of a [VCS][vcs] that supports a diff tool is [Git][git]. It is a distributed [VCS][vcs] that provides a command named "[diff][git-diff]" for showing the changes between two source versions. May check the documentation of ```git diff``` for complete details.

### Problem
Usually, output generated by diff tools are linear. An individual will have a hard time comparing source files especially if there are many conflicts involved. Is there an alternative display format for addressing this issue? What can be used that can be integrated with [Git][git]?

### Solution
Many diff tools like [WinMerge][winmerge] and [P4Merge][p4merge] support a more visual output. Some of the core features are side-by-side comparison and text highlighting. May check the tools first and try them out to see if they can really be useful on your side.

Given that you liked the tools mentioned above, can they be integrated directly with [Git][git]? Fortunately, Git provided the commands [difftool][difftool] and [mergetool][mergetool] for using external diff tools. Also, Git already provided a [guide for customizations][git-config]. May check the section The "*External Merge and Diff Tools*"" section for integrating [P4Merge][p4merge] with [Git][git].

Before, I usually use [WinMerge][winmerge] for direct comparison of files but when I started using [Git][git], I encountered [P4Merge][p4merge] and I'm very happy with its support for [Three-Way Merging][three-way]. I can easily understand the desired change as the origin file is included in comparison.

Hope this helps. Thank you. #RoadToBeABetterDeveloper
