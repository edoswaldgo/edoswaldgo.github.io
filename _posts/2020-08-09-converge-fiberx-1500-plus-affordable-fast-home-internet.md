## Introduction

Last month, I received a notification from [Converge][converge] that their [add-on promo][converge-1500-plus] for _Fiber X Plan 1500_ is still available. You only need to add _**99 PHP per month**_ to upgrade your connection from _**25 Mbps to 35 Mbps**_!


I highly recommend the add-on promo for existing Converge subscribers especially if you belong the following.

1. someone who wants a better value plan without breaking the bank.
2. someone who loves to watch [Netflix][netflix] in 4K / UltraHD for added buffer (see bandwidth recommendations [here][netflix-recommendation]).
3. someone who gets impatient in downloading large PC or console games and updates (_Hooray for the additional 1.25MB/s_).
4. member of a household (_5-6 pax_) that streams multiple high-resolution videos simultaneously


Amidst the pandemic, maybe you are planning to subscribe to a new fiber plan for your work from home setup. Choosing the right plan can be a daunting task because you will be sticking with it for quite a long time. Let's find out if this is the right plan for you.


## Internet Fiber Plans

Below are the lists of the plan offerings of Converge, PLDT, and Globe as of _09-August 2020_. 

The costs prepared only cover the base plan price. I did not include the contract duration and extras like installation fee, modem fee, and freebies in order to simplify the computation. 

Let's also assume that they all have the same reliability rate and level of customer support to not have any biases.

## Comparison

### Higher Plans are Cheaper

All the plans of the ISPs (Internet Service Provider) above have more bang for your buck (_lower cost per Mbps_) as you go with higher plans. Should you just avail the highest / most expensive plan then? **Definitely not!**

You will be shelling out a LOT more of your hard-earned money and a regular household probably couldn't fully utilize the bandwidth of these plans.

**Note:** It is also important to consider that you have your mobile data plan as well. Try summing up all your phone and Internet bills, you might be surprised how much you're spending per year.

### Affordable Plans

Amongst the affordable / lower-tier plans, Converge Fiber X 1500 with add-on is the most affordable one with the highest bandwidth.

But, Converge does not offer a landline. All PLDT and Globe plans include a landline which normally costs around 700 PHP per month.

You might be shocked once you see the huge drop of the price per Mbps after we factored out the cost of landline.

| Provider     | Plan                     | Price                   | Price <br> (landline cost removed) | Bandwidth | Cost per Mbps <br> (w/o landline) |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------: | ---------------------------------: | --------: | --------------------------------: |
| Converge     | Fiber X 1500             |                   1500  |                               same |        25 |                             60.00 |
| Converge     | Fiber X 1500 (w/ Add-on) |                   1599  |                               same |        35 |                             45.69 |
| PLDT         | Unli Fibr 1299           |                   1299  |                                599 |        10 |                             59.90 |
| PLDT         | Unli Fibr 1699           |                   1699  |                                999 |        25 |                             39.96 |
| PLDT         | Unli Fibr 2399           |                   2399  |                               1699 |        50 |                             33.98 |
| Globe        | Unli Plan 1899           |                   1899  |                               1199 |        30 |                             39.96 |
| Globe        | Unli Plan 2499           |                   2499  |                               1799 |        50 |                             35.98 |


Turns out that PLDT Unli Fibr 1699 and Globe Unli Plan 1899 have cheaper bandwidth price than Converge Fiber X 1500 (w/ Add-on). _*shocked*_

Should you just go for PLDT or Globe, then? **It depends.** If you need or want a landine, definitely go with PLDT or Globe. Otherwise, go for Converge.


## Conclusion

Every household / person has different needs and use cases. For our case, subscribing to Converge Fiber X 1500 (w/ add-on) is the right plan because we don't need a landline. Even if the cost per Mbps is slightly higher, the total cost per year is still lower.

Remember to check your budget first before determining your wants. Also, don't ever forget to include mobile data plans of every household member when budgeting.

Hope my post helped you decide! Stay safe!
