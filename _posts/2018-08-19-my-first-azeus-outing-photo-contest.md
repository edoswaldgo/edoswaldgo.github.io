## Introduction

[Azeus Systems Philippines Ltd.][azeus] annually holds a company outing and the chosen destination for this year (*April 28-29, 2018*) is [Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar][lascasas]. The resort is located at Bagac, Bataan and it takes around 3hrs to get there if you are coming from Manila.

The venue is very picturesque as it lets you experience the old Manila. The venue is full of Spanish-Filipino houses and structures with a canal which seems to be inspired by Venice. If you are a fan of Intramuros or Vigan, you will probably also like this place. It is also a great summer destination as the venue gives you access to the beautiful beach in Bataan.

## Photo Contest

Aside from relaxing, eating, and having fun, the Azeus Photography Enthusiasts (APE) group organized a photo contest for capturing this year's company outing. Any employee can join the contest using any camera. The contest is composed of the following categories.

### Categories

- People / Portrait
- Landscape
- Architecture
- Post-processed

## My Entries

I decided to join the photo contest to motivate me to take more photos and to learn more about photography. In short, I need to utilize the camera I bought before. *hahaha!*

### People / Portrait

<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/oswaldogo/41438914910/in/datetaken-public/" title="Finding The Right One"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1822/41438914910_664f5e2172_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Finding The Right One"></a>

The caption of this photo intrigued some people as to why I am still finding the right one even if I already found her. *haha!* I decided to have a vague caption just to cover different perspectives. It can also be finding the right shot for me / her.

### Landscape

<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/oswaldogo/42344590925/in/datetaken-public/" title="Solo sa Init, Solo sa Lamig"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1790/42344590925_9c99164581_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Solo sa Init, Solo sa Lamig"></a>

The caption was inspired by the Filipino phrase, "*Sala sa init, sala sa lamig*", which is similar to the "*Hot and cold*" idiom. I just related the phrase to this plant as it is going solo for hot and cold weather.

### Architecture

<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/oswaldogo/42530285344/in/datetaken-public/" title="Doorception"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1786/42530285344_24085fe9d4_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Doorception"></a>

Well the caption for this photo is rather straightforward. I am seeing doors inside the door.

### Post-processed

<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-header="false" data-footer="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/oswaldogo/42530285754/in/datetaken-public/" title="Reflect Reflect Pag May Time"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/919/42530285754_b2e065cf70_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Reflect Reflect Pag May Time"></a>

Given that I had some time, I tried creating a reflection of the nightscape via post-processing. I edited the raw photo using [Lightroom][lightroom] and used [GIMP][gimp] for the reflection. You may check on the tutorial that I followed for creating this rough reflection below.

## Conclusion

Fortunately, I was able to participate in all categories. I am surprised that my entries did quite well and am very happy that some appreciate my tastes. Feel free to provide comments and suggestions on my shots. I will be glad to hear them.

There will be an upcoming company event this September, Azeus Sportsfest 2018. The Azeus Photography Enthusiasts (APE) group will be organizing another photo contest. I have yet to decide if I will be taking photgraphs because of the jam-packed event schedule.

Cheers!
