## Introduction

Remember the sportsfest event I mentioned on my first photo contest [post](../my-first-azeus-outing-photo-contest)? [Azeus Systems Philippines Ltd.][azeus] held this year's sportsfest last September 01 at the [Meralco Gym][meralco-gym] in Pasig City. The gym's sports facilities lie inside the huge compound of [Meralco][meralco] and offer wide range of sports activities from ball to racket sports like Basketball, Volleyball, Soccer, Badminton, Tennis, Table Tennis, and etcetera.

In case you're organizing a sports event or just finding a nearby place to burn some calories, you may check the venue details below and contact them via landline.

The categories of the photo contest depend on the number of sports event. Below are the categories composing the sportsfest photo contest.

### Categories

- Badminton
- Basketball
- Chess
- Dodgeball
- Indoor Games
- Table Tennis
- Volleyball

## My Entries

I was only able to join three out of the seven categories, namely Chess, Indoor Games, and Table Tennis. I still consider myself to be lucky for being able to take some pictures given the hectic schedule. I also wanted to shoot other sports events but seemed impossible as I am participating on those specific events as a player.

### Chess

## My Tools

I used my Fujifilm X-A10 camera with Meike 35mm f1.7 lens for capturing these photos. Are you interested how I end up buying X-A10 as my first camera? You may check my post [here](../buying-my-first-camera-fujifilm-xa10).

For the minor enhancements of the raw files, I still used [Lightroom Mobile][lightroom] and resized them via [GIMP][gimp]. If you want me to create a post about my simple editing workflow, feel free to comment or directly message me.

## Conclusion

The jam-packed company event was quite tiring but fun! Sadly, for this photo contest, only a handful joined. I hope more people join in the future and I would like to give special thanks to Mr. Cole Fabros for organizing this photo contest.
