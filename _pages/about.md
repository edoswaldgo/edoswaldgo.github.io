Hi, I am Ed Oswald Go, a graduate from De La Salle University - Manila with a BS degree in Computer Science. I pursued a career in IT and have become a full-time software developer based in the Philippines.

I consider myself to be a lifelong learner, given my hunger for knowledge and drive for constant improvement of diverse interests. I believe in continuous learning as there are too many things to try out in life. You might bump into one of your new hobby or passion.

I created this website not only to learn new technical things but also to share information which may be helpful to you. This site acts as a medium for documenting some of my experiences about software development, technology, gadgets, travel, and photography. I will try to publish new posts at least twice a month, but hopefully publish every Sunday evening.

If you are a software developer, technology enthusiast, traveler, or a casual photographer, this website will pique your interest. Follow my journey by viewing my recent posts [here](/blog).

You may reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.author.linkedin }}) or [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/{{ site.author.flickr }}).

Cheers!
